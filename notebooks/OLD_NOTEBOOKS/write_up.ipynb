    "# Introduction\n",
    "After the creation of President Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing, many police departments pushed to implement community focused policing tactics. This meant creating a more comprehensive support system for the community, focusing on wholistic public health rather than arrests and convicion numbers. As an extension of this, our team decided to look into Boston Analytic's police report dataset, which included records of all police reports filed from 2015 to 2019. We wanted to analyze police reports to see what sort of emergency responses correlated with different predictors. For example, if we could predict 911 calls that had a high likelihood of involving domestic abuse, then we could make sure to send someone with special training in that field specifically to those calls. Similarly with drug related cases, or cases involving weapons. Through this analysis, we could supplement police response by helping with effective resource allocation."

    "# Data Cleaning\n",
    "Describe what data we dropped and why. Include EDA graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first dropped rows with a substantial amount of missing data, since these would not help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We looked for ways to create a master dataframe with which we could train and test our model. To do this, we had to combine many CSVs by certain indices. The data sets were very large, so we sampled from some of them to make certain processes faster, without giving up the integrity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One issue was that the crime reports gave location in terms of longitude and latitude. To combine closest property value, which only had street addresses, with crime, we had to use geocoding, which is the process of converting addresses to longitude and latitude. Once the property addresses were converted into longitude and latitude, we then found the average neighborhood property value to a given crime. This was computationally difficult since we needed to test many properties for each crime to achieve this, but once we did it one time, we could save that CSV for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We followed a similar technique to find how far away the closest streetlight was to the crime. Using the coordinates of the streetlights, we found how far away the closest streetlight was to a crime by converting from coordinate Euclidean distance to a familiar distance metric. Again, this was computationally taxing, but only needed to be performed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We repeated the above step for police stations, hospitals, and schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We looked at weather for each day in Boston, to see if it affected type of crime. We took the average temperature, precipitation amount, and snow amount to see whether there was a relationship.\n",
