    "# Introduction\n",
    "After the creation of President Obama's 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing, many police departments pushed to implement community focused policing tactics. This meant creating a more comprehensive support system for the community, focusing on wholistic public health rather than arrests and convicion numbers. As an extension of this, our team decided to look into Boston Analytic's police report dataset, which included records of all police reports filed from 2015 to 2019. We wanted to analyze police reports to see what sort of emergency responses correlated with different predictors. For example, if we could predict 911 calls that had a high likelihood of involving domestic abuse, then we could make sure to send someone with special training in that field specifically to those calls. Similarly with drug related cases, or cases involving weapons. Through this analysis, we could supplement police response by helping with effective resource allocation."

Talk about the accuracy rates and what biases we have to keep in mind about this. predictive could be, given that we had a 911 call at this location at this time, whats the chance that its a domestic abuse issue? maybe we need to make sure we send someone with training in that department. same goes for drugs, or weapons related crimes."
